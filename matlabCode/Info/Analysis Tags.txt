*AVOID: This is a unique tag. It exists in the metadata of a particular experiment/analysis, not in the tag list for the entire cell. Takes a bool value of 0 or 1. If 1, then avoid the particular experiment/analysis for this cell, but you don't have to avoid the entire cell. Filter on this tag in the batch analysis, not using the filtering app.

*Avoid For Tuning: Don't use the tuning curve of this cell for batch analysis

*Preliminary Data: Recording occured before 2021. Do not use for OKR batch analysis. Cells were of all types

*Cesium: Cell attached recording was done using a cesium external solution (i.e. using the internal solution).

*Down Cell: Cell is direction selective and prefers dorsal --> ventral motion across the retina.

*Mislabeled: Labelled via retrograde injection, but probably the wrong cell type. Probably shouldn't include in batch analysis

*MTN: MTN-projecting ganglion cell. Labelled via retrograde injection

*Phasic: Firing Rate to a moving grating stim was phasic (usually in phase with the grating)

*Tonic: Firing Rate to a moving grating stim was tonic sustained

*UP Cell: Cell is direction selective and prefers ventral --> dorsal motion across the retina.
